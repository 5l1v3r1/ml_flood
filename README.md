### Project description

We plan to investigate a few different ML techniques for forecasting floods. The main goal is a comparison between those algorithms on this proposed subject. As a side goal, the open source development approach via github will result in a nice basis for further work.

ERA5 data will be used as predictor to model either the probability of exceeding some threshold in river discharge by the GloFAS reanalysis or to predict the severeness of the event given by the ECMWFâ€™s severe event catalogue. We plan to investigate the impact of different meteorological variables, starting with direct precipitation output and combinations of thermodynamic and dynamic variables.
Additionally, the results can be compared with GloFAS forecast reruns as well. Thereby, the gain/loss of ML techniques  to complex model output could potentially be determined.

Our projected workflow can be seen below:
